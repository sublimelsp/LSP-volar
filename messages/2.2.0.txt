# Breaking change

 - External imports are longer suggested in completions.
   ("javascript.suggest.autoImports" and "typescript.suggest.autoImports" settings are disabled by default)

That's due to Sublime Text not handling a large number of completions (8MB of payload some cases) too well and causing UI freezes.

If you rely on that feature then you can override those settings manually from "Preferences: LSP-volar Settings" in Command Palette.
